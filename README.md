<h1>ABOUT THE DATASET</h1>
The dataset provides a clear picture of sales and customer behavior across various store locations. Stores like London and Denver stand out for their strong sales, with laptops contributing significantly to revenue. Everyday items like notepads and pens are consistently popular, while younger customers often purchase school-related items like backpacks. Most transactions happen online, followed by in-store purchases, while phone orders are less common. Customers are generally satisfied, but there are occasional low ratings, highlighting room for improvement in areas like service or delivery. Coupons encourage big-ticket purchases, like laptops, but aren’t used as much as they could be. To improve, businesses should focus on stocking high-demand products, use targeted marketing for different customer groups, and make better use of coupons. Strengthening the online shopping experience and using data to predict trends can also help improve operations and drive more sales.

<h1>OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT</h1>
The objective of the project is to analyze sales data across various dimensions, such as customer demographics, purchase methods, store locations, and product performance, to derive actionable insights. The aim is to identify trends, optimize inventory management, improve customer satisfaction, enhance marketing strategies, and address underperforming areas. By leveraging these insights, the project seeks to drive business growth, improve operational efficiency, and align services with customer preferences for better decision-making.
